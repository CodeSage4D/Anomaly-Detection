# Step 1: Import necessary libraries and modules
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neighbors import LocalOutlierFactor
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

# Step 2: Load the dataset from a CSV file
# Read the data from 'your_dataset.csv' using pandas and store it in the 'dataset' variable
dataset = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Step 3: Split the dataset into training and testing sets
# Use train_test_split function to split the dataset into X_train, X_test, y_train, and y_test
# test_size=0.2 indicates 20% of the data will be used for testing, random_state=42 for reproducibility
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(dataset, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 4: Train a Machine Learning model on the training set (using Local Outlier Factor as an example)
# Create an instance of the LocalOutlierFactor model with contamination=0.1 to define the proportion of outliers
model = LocalOutlierFactor(contamination=0.1)
# Fit the model on the training data
model.fit(X_train)

# Step 5: Predict anomalies on the testing set
# Use the trained model to predict the labels for the testing set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Step 6: Identify novel anomalies
# Create a list containing the predicted labels that are equal to -1 (indicating anomalies)
novel_anomalies = [x for x in y_pred if x == -1]

# Step 7: Calculate evaluation metrics
# Calculate precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's performance
precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)
f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)

# Step 8: Print the results and visualization
# Print the list of novel anomalies
print("Novel Anomalies:", novel_anomalies)
# Print the calculated precision, recall, and F1-score
print("Precision:", precision)
print("Recall:", recall)
print("F1-score:", f1)
