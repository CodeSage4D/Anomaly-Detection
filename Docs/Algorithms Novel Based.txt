/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

1) Preprocessing:

Execute any necessary data preparation operations, such as addressing missing values, scaling, or normalisation.

2) Engineering Features

Determine the pertinent features or variables from the dataset that capture the traits of typical behaviour.
To create new features that might improve the anomaly detection process, use domain knowledge.

3) Initialization of the model:

Set up the variables and model parameters.
Establish suitable cutoffs or criteria for detecting abnormalities.

4) Modelling Instruction:

Train the model using the dataset's typical cases.
Investigate innovative approaches or algorithms that improve on conventional ones.
To capture complicated patterns or relationships, use cutting-edge statistical or machine learning approaches.

5) Anomalous Findings:

Use fresh, untrained cases from the dataset to test the learned model.
For each incident, determine a score or probability reflecting how far from the norm it is.
Use cutting-edge techniques to improve the accuracy of anomaly detection, such as ensemble approaches or deep learning architectures.

6) Choosing a threshold

Identify the ideal cutoff or standards for labelling some events as anomalies.
Think about creative methods for adjusting thresholds dynamically based on the attributes of the dataset or the anticipated anomaly rates.

7) Visualisation of Anomalies:

To properly illustrate discovered abnormalities, use novel visualization approaches.
To assist in the explanation of anomalies, use interactive visualizations or dimensionality reduction methods.

8) Evaluation:

Utilize the right measures, such as accuracy, recall, F1-score, or area under the ROC curve, to assess the algorithm's performance.
Compare the algorithm's performance against the best anomaly detection techniques currently in use.
Perform tests on diverse datasets to show the suggested algorithm's superiority and originality.

9) Optimization and fine-tuning:

Identify opportunities for improvement and optimization based on the evaluation results.
Add feedback loops to the algorithm to constantly enhance its performance.
Investigate creative methods for fine-tuning model parameters and improving the model's capacity to detect abnormalities reliably.

10) Record keeping and Publication:

Write up the algorithm, together with the experimental setting, methods, and outcomes.
Write a thorough report or research paper detailing the innovative features of the suggested algorithm.
To add to the corpus of knowledge, submit the work to conferences or publications that are pertinent.
